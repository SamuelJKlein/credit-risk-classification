Module 20 Challenge
 The model is meant to predict if a customer’s loan is high risk based on a number of factors including the customer’s income, number of accounts, loan size, and more. 

The following are the classification metrics for this model:
- Overall accuracy: 99%
- Precision (high risk loan): 84%
- Precision (healthy loan): 94%
- Recall (high risk loan): 94%
- Recall (healthy loan): 99%

Summary:
This is a reasonably accurate model for predicting high risk loans, based on the results of the classification report.
